## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using El Ayuntamiento de Madrid data from 2019 about traffic accidents in Madrid to better understand:

1. How many traffic accident occurred in Madrid during 2019?, How many people are involved? and What is the average number of people involved in a traffic accident?
2. What day of the week are there the most accidents?
3. What time do most accidents occur?
4. At what age are more traffic accidents suffered?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 files available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  
1. README.md
2. 2019_Accidentalidad.csv
  - Traffic accidents in the City of Madrid registered by the Municipal Police.
  - One record is included per person involved in the accident.
  - Witness records not included.
  
3. Traffic_accident.py, This `.py` file runs the necessary code to obtain the answers to the avobe questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
